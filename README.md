The following info is included in the table:


National_Debt_Trillions: Total US federal debt (public + intragovernmental)
Debt_to_GDP_Percent: Debt as percentage of Gross Domestic Product
Median_Rent_Monthly: National median monthly rent for 2-bedroom apartment
Median_Home_Price: US median home sale price
Median_Mortgage_Monthly: Estimated monthly payment (30-year, 20% down, average rate)
Debt_Per_Capita: National debt divided by US population
Rent_Burden_Index: Indexed to 2000 (100 = baseline year)

US Debt currently stands at 38 Trillion Dollars!

Which leads us to one question... does the US debt affect home prices over time? specifically, does it affect your mortgage? Yes, Yes it does!
